What is a class type?

What is a class object?

What is a class definition

Classes define a namespace

That namespace is implemented, like all namespaces, with a dictionary

What is a descriptor?
A mechanism which overrides the default attribute binding behavior.
IOW, if a descriptor is defined for a class, then the descriptor implementation is invoked instead of simply retrieving the attribute through the class's __dict__ attribute

Are descriptors only available for new-style classes?
Yes
