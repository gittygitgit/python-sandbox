# Object

# Type

# Value

# All objects have an identify, a type, and a value

# An object's identity never changes
# An object's type never changes
a=1
b=2
c=1
print a is b # prints False
print a is c # prints True

print id(a)
print id(b)

# an object's identity can be considered its memory address

# Some objs are mutable, others aren't
# numbers, strings and typles are immutable
# dictionaries and lists are mutable

# containers contain references to other objects
# tuples, lists and dictionaries

# An object's type determines the object's behavior.
