# What is it?
# Related to dynamic typing
# Places focus on an object's methods and properties rather than it's actual type
# Duck-typed languages support polymorphism without using inheritance.

# Example?
# If a function accepts a parameter, and invokes quack on that parameter, the function
# considers that parameter a duck, no matter what type the parameter is.


# Are types used?
# No, an object's type is not used to determine if it has a method or property.
# The method or property is simply used
# Essentially, the object's interface is defined by it's methods and properties, not it's type
